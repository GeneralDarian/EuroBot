# Project Structure

```
.
├── doc
├── src
└── tools
```

The project is structured in the following way:

- `doc/`

  - This is where all the bots documentation is located.

- `src/`

  - This is where all the source code is located.

- `tools/`

  - This is where all the scripts that aren’t required for the bot to run but
    which assist are located.  For example `format.sh` to format source code is
    located here.
