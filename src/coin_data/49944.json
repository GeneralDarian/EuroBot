Strategically situated between Europe, Asia and Africa, Crete fell to a series of conquerors, from the<br />\r\nRomans and the Saracens to the Venetians and the Ottomans. Union with the modern Greek state was hard<br />\r\nwon by the Cretans after several violent uprisings, including the Cretan Revolt of 1866 marked by the selfsacrifice of hundreds of besieged at the Arkadi Monastery. After the revolt of 1897-98, the island was<br />\r\ndeclared an autonomous \u2018Cretan State\u2019, with Prince George of Greece appointed its High Commissioner. Crete was formally integrated into Greece under the Treaty of London in 1913, after the Balkan Wars of 1912-13.<br />\r\nThe coin was issued in bankrolls, in Proof quality along with the proof year set and in BU quality on a coincard blister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5e3dc8655c520.jpg\"Group=\"bb1236295025\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5e3dc8655c520.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"123\" /></a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5e3dc870be518.jpg\"Group=\"bb1236295025\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5e3dc870be518.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"149\" /></a>",
