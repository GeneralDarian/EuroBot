Also, the inner part of the coin bears the dates \u201c2011\u201d, the year of issue, and \u201c1811\u201d, the year in which Emperor Alexander I of Russia decreed that an \u201cExchange, Lending and Deposit Office\u201d was to be established in Turku, Finland. It was Finland\u2019s first bank and eventually became the Bank of Finland, which moved to Helsinki in 1819. The Bank began to operate as a central bank in the latter part of the 19th century after Finland obtained its monetary unit and commercial banks had been established in the country. The coin\u2019s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",
