    "comments": "The National Museum of Slovenia (Slovene: Narodni muzej Slovenije) is located in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. It is situated in the Center district of the city near Tivoli City Park. Along with the Slovenian Museum of Natural History, located in the same building, the National Museum of Slovenia is the country&#039;s oldest scientific and cultural institution. The museum has an extensive collection of archaeological artefacts, old coins and banknotes (in the numismatics department on the ground floor) and displays related to the applied arts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe museum was founded in 1821 as the &quot;Estate Museum of Carniola&quot; (German: Krainisch St\u00e4ndisches Museum). Five years later, the Austrian Emperor Francis I decided to personally sponsor the museum and ordered its renaming to &quot;Provincial Museum of Carniola&quot;. In 1882, the museum was renamed to &quot;Provincial Museum of Carniola - Rudolfinum&quot; in honour of the Crown Prince Rudolph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the name was changed to &quot;National Museum&quot;. In 1923 the ethnographic collections possessed by the museum were removed and placed in the new Slovene Ethnographic Museum and in 1933 much of its fine artwork was moved to the National Gallery of Slovenia. In 1944 the Slovenian Museum of Natural History (then known as the Museum of Natural Sciences) became independent despite being located in the same building. In 1953 the majority of archives were moved to the Gruber Palace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRenamed to National Museum of Slovenia in 1992, today the museum is divided into Archaeological Department, a Numismatic Cabinet, a Department of Prints and Drawings and a Department of History and the Applied Arts.",
