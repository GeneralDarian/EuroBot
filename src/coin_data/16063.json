    "comments": "The Battle of Marathon took place in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. It was fought between the citizens of Athens, aided by Plataea, and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes. The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to subjugate Greece. The Greek army lead by Miltiades, decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars. This victory was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. The following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society and so the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history. <br />\r\nThe coin was issued in bankrolls and in BU allong with the official year KMS blister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5e3dd58b6ca0e.jpg\"Group=\"bb61822413\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5e3dd58b6ca0e.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"176\" /></a>",
