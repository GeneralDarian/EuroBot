The contour of a hand in the background symbolises the different kinds of help given by the organisation to the people, mostly medical, but also and among others: cooperating, constructing and supporting. At the left side, in semicircle, the inscription \u2018CRUZ VERMELHA PORTUGUESA\u2019. At the top, the Coat of Arms and the name of the issuing country \u2018PORTUGAL\u2019 and at the bottom the years \u20181865\u2019 and \u20182015\u2019. The coin\u2019s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",
