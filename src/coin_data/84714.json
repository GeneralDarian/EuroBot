    "comments": "An ingenious forerunner of modern comedy, Plautus was born in Sarsina, a small and lively town now part of Emilia-Romagna. His originality lies in the extraordinary expressive power of his lively and flamboyant dialogue, which he borrows from common people and best interprets in his plays. The special richness of a language finely combining farce and wit is also part of his great originality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/574c3f6360ee7.jpg\"Group=\"bb894887483\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/574c3f6360ee7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"192\" /></a>",
