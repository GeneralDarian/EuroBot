The profile in the background shows Charles de Gaulle in army general is uniform during the call to arms of the 18th June 1940 or during the liberation of Paris. The profile in the foreground represents Charles de Gaulle during his second presidential term of office. Finally, the mention RF is semi-integrated in a Lorraine cross, symbol of free France chosen by General de Gaulle in 1940. His dates of birth and death as well as the year date are also inscribed in the Lorraine cross.\r\nThe coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
