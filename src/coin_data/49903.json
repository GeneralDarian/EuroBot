Upon his return to Athens from the first journey to Italy in 387 B.C., he founded a philosophical school in the area of Academia (today\u2019s Kolonos) named after the local hero Academos. For nearly 1,000 years (until 529 A.D.), the Academy enjoyed a reputation for excellence, building on and renewing the teachings of its founder. The ideas of the Academy were transmitted to the Arab world and, from there, to Medieval Europe. The word academy and its derivatives are now used in almost all languages for notions associated with higher learning, the scholarly community and prestigious cultural institutions.<br />\r\nThe coin was issued in bankrolls, in Proof quality along with the proof year set and in BU quality on a coincard blister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5e3dce6394194.jpg\"Group=\"bb202651364\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5e3dce6394194.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"216\" /></a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5e3dce745c7aa.jpg\"Group=\"bb202651364\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5e3dce745c7aa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"149\" /></a>",
