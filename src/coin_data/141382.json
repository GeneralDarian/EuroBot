After surviving deportation to Auschwitz, she went on\r\nto become one of the most important actors in Europe\u2019s building. She was the first elected president of the European\r\nParliament from 1979 to 1982. She symbolizes the depenalization of abortion she fought for with the law bearing her\r\nname voted in 1975. In 2008, she is elected at the French Academy.\r\nHer deportation registration number appears on her collar. The background depicts the European Parliament on which\r\nher name, key dates, indication of the country \u2018RF\u2019, year of issuance \u20182018\u2019 and the mintmarks are inscribed.\r\nThe coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
