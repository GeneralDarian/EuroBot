        "description": "Since the 1990s, the fight against breast cancer has been a major cause around the world. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the pink ribbon, iconic symbol of this fight, Monnaie de Paris has decided to support this cause. For nearly 15 years, a pink ribbon prize has been presented every year to support research efforts and innovation.\r\nThe design represents a woman's bust symbolically protected by a hand and the colored ribbon. It is surrounded, at the right side, by the inscription '25e ANNIVERSAIRE DU RUBAN ROSE' (25th anniversary of the pink ribbon). The right side also features the years '1992 - 2017', the indication of the issuing country 'RF' and the mintmarks.\r\nThe coin's outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
