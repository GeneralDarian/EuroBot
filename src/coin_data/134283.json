It started as a means of helping injured veterans of the First World War, but before long had been adopted by the whole French nation as a symbol of gratitude for the sacrifices the soldiers had made to defend their country and their ideals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, as in the past, the cornflower still provides moral and financial support to veterans and victims of wars past and present and to victims of terrorism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt also helps pass on to young people standards and values such as respect, peace and tolerance. This flower of remembrance honors all those who fought and are still fighting for our freedom today.",
