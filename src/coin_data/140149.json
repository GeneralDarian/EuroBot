It was an important national event that shaped Belgium\u2019s national politics and influenced subsequent Government reforms, now 50 years ago. The mintmark of Utrecht (the Mercury\u2019s wand) is located on the left together with the Belgian mint master mark (the coat of arms of the municipality Herzele). The year mark 2018 and the country code BE are located at the left as well, just like the initials LL of the designer of the coin, Luc Luycx. An auditorium marks the back, which is a reference to students. The coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
