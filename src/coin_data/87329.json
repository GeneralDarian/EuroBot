    "comments": "The coin dedicated to a suspension bridge connecting the city of Lisbon (Portugal), to the municipality of Almada on the left (south) bank of the Tagus river. It has a total length of 2,277 metres (7,470 ft), making it the 46th longest suspension bridge in the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom its inauguration on 6 August 1966 up to 1974, the bridge was named Salazar Bridge (Ponte Salazar), after Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, who ordered its construction. After the Carnation Revolution, which overthrew the remnants of Salazar&#039;s regime, the bridge was renamed for April 25, the date of the revolution. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater changes had to be made due to the rapid increase in population. In the 1990s, a fifth car lane was added, and in 1999, a lower deck, used as a railway track, which was planned since the beginning, was finally built.[4] Today, the upper deck carries six car lanes while the lower deck carries a double track railway, electrified at 25 kV AC.",
