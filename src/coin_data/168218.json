The design unites music, national costumes, and the various sites of the great and powerful Song Celebration of the nation by the sea. The design also features the first notes of the Estonian national anthem and, at the bottom, the words \u2018Laulupidu 150\u2019 (Song Celebration 150). At the top is the year of issuance \u20182019\u2019 and underneath the name of the issuing country \u2018EESTI\u2019.\r\nThe coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
