After passing through Brazil and Japan in the last two editions, the Summer Olympics are returning to Europe and this event with strong international resonance takes over the city of Paris a century after the games of 1924. On the occasion of the countdown to the Olympic Games in Paris 2024, Monnaie de Paris wishes to celebrate the road to the games through a mix of Paris and the French numismatic heritage. The intensity thus gradually rises during the years preceding the event.",
