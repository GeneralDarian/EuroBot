In rushes depicted on the right there is an aquatic warbler, above \u2013 a flock of common cranes and a mute swan, symbolising the establishment of the Reserve.\r\nThe design is surrounded by inscriptions LIETUVA (LITHUANIA), \u017dUVINTAS, UNESCO, the year of issue (2021) and the mintmark of the Lithuanian Mint.\r\nThe design is realised by Egl\u0117 Ratkut\u0117 and Ernestas \u017demaitis.\r\nThe coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",

Instead of the Lithuanian inscription LAISV\u0116 * VIENYB\u0116 * GEROV\u0116 *, the Latvian inscription DIEVS * SV\u0112T\u012a * LATVIJU is used on the edge. The error only occurs on coins that are in the BU coincard. It is estimated that up to 10 percent of the BU coins got the Latvian edge lettering.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The Bank of Lithuania asked the Lithuanian Mint to clarify the circumstances of the events and to ensure the prevention of errors in the future. An internal investigation is being carried out at the Lithuanian Mint, and additional process control and prevention actions have been taken. The Lithuanian Mint regrets the situation.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSource: Lietuvos Bankas<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/61d68dcf9bb0b.jpg\"Group=\"bb534582438\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/61d68dcf9bb0b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"137\" /></a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/61d68dddaf3d8.jpg\"Group=\"bb534582438\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/61d68dddaf3d8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"146\" /></a>",
