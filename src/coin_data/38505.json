The event is held every three years to highlight the family as a common human heritage, reflecting the fact that the family is universal and that it contributes to the human element of life everywhere in the world. Inscribed around the family scene are the names of the event and of the Vatican City in Italian and the year \u201c2012\u201d. The mintmark \u201cR\u201d appears between the boy and his mother. The coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European Union.",
