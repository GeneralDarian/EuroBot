This programme identifies the social role of children in five different areas with the first theme being \u2018Solidarity through Love\u2019. This design was created by Ms Sarah Cilia a secondary school student who has expressed this theme through two hands forming a heart shape which displays a representation of the Maltese flag. At the bottom of the design is the inscription \u2018MALTA 2016\u2019. Two stylised representations of human bodies are designed on the left wrist and two on the right one. The coin\u2019s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",

    "comments": "The Central Bank of Malta will issue a \u20ac2 commemorative coin under a new programme entitled &#039;From Children in Solidarity&#039;, with the first theme being &#039;Solidarity through Love&#039;. This is an initiative between the Central Bank of Malta, the Ministry for Education and Employment, and the Malta Community Chest Fund. The Malta Community Chest Fund is a charitable foundation under the auspices of The President of Malta. It promotes various activities and initiatives that are undertaken with the aim of helping individuals with various needs. <br />\r\nOfficially launched on 5 June 2015 by the President of Malta, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca and the Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, this social responsibility coin programme involved a coin design competition open to all secondary school students. From the designs submitted, five were selected by an adjudicating panel. The winning design was subsequently selected through a voting process which was open to all secondary school students. Schools encouraged students to take part in this voting exercise as this was seen as a way of promoting a sense of responsible citizenship from an early age.<br />\r\nThe coin reverse shows the common \u20ac2 side while the obverse (national side) shows two hands forming a heart shape, framing a representation of the Maltese flag. The coin obverse engraved by Noel Galea Bason bears a representation of the winning design created by Ms Sarah Cilia, a secondary school student. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCoincard with the Monnaie de Paris mintmark:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/585672cbeb101.jpg\"Group=\"bb1152873654\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/585672cbeb101.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"83\" height=\"250\" /></a><a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/585672d6192ed.jpg\"Group=\"bb1152873654\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/585672d6192ed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"83\" height=\"250\" /></a><a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/585672e056db8.jpg\"Group=\"bb1152873654\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/585672e056db8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"207\" /></a>",
