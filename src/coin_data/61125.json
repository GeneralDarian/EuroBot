By means of the 1964 constitution Malta became an independent nation for the first time after hundreds of years of foreign domination.

It shows a young woman, representing Malta, carrying the Maltese flag. At the right, in semi-circle, the inscription \u2018MALTA \u2014 Independence 1964\u2019 and at the bottom the year of issuance \u20182014\u2019. The coin\u2019s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",
