This flower of remembrance honors all those who fought and are still fighting for our freedom today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo varieties of the Obverse are known:<br />\r\nDie A &nbsp;\u2013 numeral 2 in date 2018 has single head.<br />\r\nDie B \u2013 numeral 2 in date 2018 has double head.<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5c883a31b3c0c.jpg\"Group=\"bb2068599460\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5c883a31b3c0c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"80\" /></a>",
