At the bottom of\r\nthe design is the year of issuance \u20182019\u2019 and at its right the indication of the issuing country \u2018D\u2019. The coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",

    "comments": "Thirty years ago, the Berlin Wall fell. Beyond the impact on German society, it was an event<br />\r\nwith global consequences. On 9 November 1989, this occasion marks the end of the cold war and announces<br />\r\nappeasement after several decades of international tensions. At the European level, it is the first step towards the reunification of one of the leading countries of the European Union. This major change was after materialised by the Moscow Treaty of which France was a signatory. The European Union welcomed then 16 million new citizens in just one year; almost the structural and economic effect of welcoming a new country!",
