The ECU, standing for European Currency Unit, was the forerunner of the euro.\r\nThe national side of the coin depicts in the inner part of the piece the portrait of the Charles V, together with the text Carolus V. At the left you can find the 500 year old golden Carolus guilder, issued after the ordinance of the second period of coin issuance during the reign of Charles V. As the Royal Dutch Mint will strike the coins, the mintmark of Utrecht, a mercury staff is located on the bottom together with the Belgian mint director mintmark, the coat of arms of the municipality Herzele. It also contains the initials LL, referring to the designer of the coin, Mr. Luc Luycx. The country code BE and the year mark 2021 are located on the left. The coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag",
