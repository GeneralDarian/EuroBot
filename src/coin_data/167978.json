Created in 1959 by scenarist Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and cartoonist Albert Uderzo, this character embodies the Frenchman with his smartness and sharpness through the Gallic identity. Apart from its artistic line, depicting contemporary society with humour has brought Asterix great international fame for many years. Since its inception, it has been translated into all the languages of the European Union meeting a huge success. The reputation of Asterix is for example as strong in Germany as in France. It has also been very well established in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Scandinavia for many years. Beyond the French icon, Asterix has become a true figure of the European 9th art.",
