    "comments": "Spain started the commemorative coin series Patrimonio de la Humanidad de la UNESCO (UNESCO World Heritage) in 2010, commemorating all of Spain&#039;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which could continue until 2050. The order in which the coin for a specific site is issued coincides with the order in which they were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site.<br />\r\nPuerta del Sol is a city gate of Toledo, Spain, built in the late 14th century by the Knights Hospitaller. The medallion above the arch of the gate depicts the ordination of the Visigothic Ildephonsus, Toledo&#039;s patron saint. The gate was named because of its orientation to the east, where the sun always rises.<br />\r\nThe Synagogue of El Tr\u00e1nsito (Spanish: Sinagoga del Tr\u00e1nsito) is a historic building in Toledo, famous for its rich stucco decoration, which bears comparison with the Alcazar of Seville and the Alhambra palaces in Granada.<br />\r\nThe synagogue was founded by Samuel ha-Levi Abulafia, Treasurer to Peter of Castile, in about 1356. After the expulsion of the city&#039;s Jews under the Alhambra decree in 1492, the Synagogue came under the Order of Calatrava, who converted the building into a church serving a priory dedicated to Saint Benedict. In the 17th century the church&#039;s name changed to Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Tr\u00e1nsito: the name derives from a painting by Juan Correa de Vivar housed there, Transit of the Virgin. In 1877 the building became a national monument. The transformation of the building into the Sephardi Museum, as it is now officially called, started around 1910.",
