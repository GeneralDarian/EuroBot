He is surrounded by several symbols representing his actions: a euro symbol, as sign of his involvement in the introduction of the Euro and his European spirit, and a French flag represented in heraldic colours, itself embellished with the RF as a reference to his presidency. His dates and name are inserted in the Euro\u2019s logo. The mintmarks as well as the year date fit into the design.\r\nThe coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
