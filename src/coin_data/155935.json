        "description": "The portrait of Alexandre Lamfalussy, the first president of the EMI, on the right with his name below. On the left-hand side, the abbreviation EMI stands central with the year 1994 above, referring to the date of the establishment of the Institute and the designation of Lamfalussy as its first president. Below \u2018EMI\u2019, several coins are depicted falling on each other with the inscription \u20ac, \u2018ECU\u2019 and \u2018BEF\u2019 from top to bottom. Given the fact that this is a Belgian issuance, we have chosen for \u2018BEF\u2019, the abbreviation of our former national currency. The purpose of this representation is to symbolise the transition of the national currencies to European single currency, the euro as the EMI\u2019s\r\nmain focus was on establishing the European System of Central Banks, including the ECB and the new currency On the upper part of the left side of the coin is an inscription \u2018European Monetary Institute\u2019. The mintmark (a mercury staff is located on the left with the Belgian mint director mintmark, the coat of arms of the municipality Herzele). The country code BE and the year mark 2019 is located on the bottom. The initials LL referring to the designer of the coin, Mr Luc Luycx, are inscribed on the right. The coin\u2019s outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
