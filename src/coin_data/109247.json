The fresco cycle of the Life of St. Francis for the Basilica of Assisi, the Crucifixion for the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, the frescoes for the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua and those for the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence are among his most famous masterpieces. He was also a well-known architect: he was appointed as chief architect of the Dome of Florence and he built the bell tower, which was named after him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5912c5b356d0e.jpg\"Group=\"bb1055700589\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5912c5b356d0e.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"163\" height=\"250\" /></a><a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/5912c5babd892.jpg\"Group=\"bb1055700589\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/5912c5babd892.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"185\" /></a>",
