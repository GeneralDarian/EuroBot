Written in a semi-circle along the upper outer edge around the three flags is the inscription \u201c150\u00b0 DELL\u2019 UNIT\u00c1 D\u2019ITALIA\u201d (150th anniversary of the unification of Italy), with the letters \u201cRI\u201d superimposed on one another off-centre to the right in indication of the issuing country, the Republic of Italy. Beneath the three flags stand the dates \u201c1861 \u203a 2011 \u203a \u203a\u201d. Centred below the dates is the mintmark \u201cR\u201d, with the letters \u201cELF INC.\u201d, the initials of the artist Ettore Lorenzo Frapiccini and the first three letters of the Italian name of his profession (incisore) along the bottom edge to the right. The 12 stars of the European Union are depicted on the coin\u2019s outer ring.",
