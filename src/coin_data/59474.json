The name of the issuing country \u2018PORTUGAL\u2019 and the Coat of Arms are inscribed on the top of the flower. The center of the image shows the date of the event \u201825 DE ABRIL\u2019 (25th April) and at the bottom is written the number of years past since the revolution \u201840 ANOS\u2019 (40 years) and the year of issuance \u20182014\u2019. The shape of the letters and numbers is inspired by those used in posters and other political information supports 40 years ago, as a symbol of the euphoric period lived right after the event. The coin\u2019s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",
