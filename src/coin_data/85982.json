    "comments": "Donatello was an Italian sculptor, a drawer and an goldsmith who died in Florence on the 13th December 1466. He ranks as the father of Florentine Renaissance together with Filippo Brunelleschi and Masaccio. On the 2 euro commemorative coin is reproduced an image of David, the bronze statue made by Donatello which &nbsp;dates back to 1440 and can be admired in the Museum Bargello in Florence. The young boy is the famous biblical hero who won the battle against the giant Golia and is represented completely naked, with the hat and a sword in his right hand. The coin underlines the natural expression of the face. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/57175a5a03ba1.jpg\"Group=\"bb834344707\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/57175a5a03ba1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"133\" height=\"200\" /></a><a href=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/57175a633b121.jpg\"Group=\"bb834344707\"><img src=\"https://en.numista.com/catalogue/images/miniatures/57175a633b121.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"187\" /></a>",
