The coin of Dz\u016bkija was the third one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLithuania can be divided into historical and cultural regions (called ethnographic regions). The exact borders are not fully clear, as the regions are not official political or administrative units. They are delimited by culture, such as country traditions, traditional lifestyle, songs, tales, etc. No region, except for Samogitia, has ever been a political or an administrative entity. Despite the fact that the regions are not political/administrative entities, most regions have their &quot;capitals&quot; (cities which are commonly considered to be capitals). These cities are not necessarily the largest in the region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDz\u016bkija or Dainava is one of five ethnographic regions of Lithuania. Traditionally, Alytus is regarded as the capital of the region, although it is not the largest city in Dz\u016bkija (because Vilnius vicinities lost Lithuanian language centuries ago).",
