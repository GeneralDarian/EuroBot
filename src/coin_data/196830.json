The traditional pottery established itself for\r\nsubstantial periods of time in two districts, Latgale and Kurzeme, but only in Latgale it has survived throughout the times\r\nand passed over to the next generations. The Latgalian pottery is included also in the Latvian Culture Canon.\r\nThe design depicts a characteristic piece of Latgalian ceramics \u2013 clay candelabrum. It bears an inscription \u2018LATGALES\r\nKERAMIKA\u2019 (Latgalian ceramics), the country name \u2018LATVIJA\u2019 as well as the year of issuance \u20182020\u2019.\r\nThe coins outer ring depicts the 12 stars of the European flag.",
